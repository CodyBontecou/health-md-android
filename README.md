Health.md for Android turns Health Connect into a local-first health journal. Pick the metrics you care about, preview the output, then export clean Markdown, JSON, CSV, or Obsidian Bases YAML to a folder on your device, an Obsidian vault, any Android document provider, or an HTTPS API endpoint you control. No accounts and no Health.md health-data cloud.

## Features

### Health Connect Export

Read Health Connect data on Android and write it to plain files. Health.md supports 106 selectable Health Connect metrics across sleep, activity, heart, respiratory, vitals, body measurements, nutrition, mobility, mindfulness, reproductive health, planned/completed workouts, and feature-gated medical resources.

### Obsidian-Native Journaling

Export daily notes directly into an Obsidian vault or synced folder, use date placeholders in folder paths, customize Markdown templates, inject health sections into existing daily notes, and emit Obsidian Bases frontmatter so your health data becomes queryable in database views.

### Multiple File Formats

Choose any combination of:

- **Markdown** — readable daily summaries with optional frontmatter
- **Obsidian Bases** — YAML/frontmatter-first notes for database queries
- **JSON** — structured payloads for analysis, automation, and the Health.md Obsidian plugin
- **CSV** — one row per metric or timestamped sample for spreadsheets and notebooks

One compatibility export action can write multiple formats for multiple days.

### Raw API Snapshots

Raw API Snapshot is a separate export product for migration and archival workflows. It writes one immutable, versioned JSON or NDJSON artifact for the selected range without converting native records into daily `HealthData` summaries.

- Health Connect snapshots preserve every field exposed by the pinned AndroidX API, including native identity and metadata, nanosecond timestamps, nullable source offsets, raw enum values, nested samples/stages/routes/planned-workout structures, and exact FHIR JSON.
- Fitbit, Oura, WHOOP, and Withings snapshots preserve exact successful provider response bytes and disclose endpoint pagination and server-side aggregation. Unsupported providers are reported rather than normalized or silently replaced with Health Connect.
- Every artifact ends with a manifest containing per-type status, issues, counts, and checksums. Folder exports also receive a `.sha256` sidecar.
- Raw API uploads require HTTPS, stream from private no-backup storage, and never follow redirects.

A raw snapshot is API-complete for the app’s pinned provider API, not a transactional provider-database backup. It cannot recover inaccessible records, original units the API does not expose, deleted records, or fields unknown to the installed SDK. The separately versioned `healthmd.raw-changes` backend uses Health Connect change tokens and deletion tombstones for future incremental archive workflows.

See [Raw snapshot v1](docs/export-contract/raw-snapshot-v1.md), [raw record v1](docs/export-contract/raw-record-v1.md), and [raw changes v1](docs/export-contract/raw-changes-v1.md).

### Metric Selection & Formatting

Search metrics, enable categories, choose units, customize metric names, control filename templates (`{date}`, `{year}`, `{month}`, `{weekday}`), organize exports into folders with placeholders like `{year}/{month}` or `{quarter}`, and optionally include Android compatibility keys for existing scripts.

### Individual Entry Tracking

Alongside daily summaries, Health.md can create timestamped files for individual records:

- **Workouts** with duration, calories, distance, route status, splits, metadata, and granular samples when Health Connect provides them
- **Sleep stages** and other timestamped samples for graph reconstruction
- **Vitals** such as blood pressure, blood glucose, body temperature, and weight readings

Example output:

```text
vault/
├── Health/
│   └── 2026-02-05.md
└── entries/
    ├── workouts/
    │   └── 2026_02_05_0700_workouts.md
    ├── sleep/
    │   └── 2026_02_05_2230_sleep_rem.md
    └── vitals/
        └── 2026_02_05_0900_blood_pressure.md
```

### Automation & Shortcuts

Schedule exports with WorkManager, recover missed scheduled dates, retry from export history, and trigger exports from Tasker, adb, or other automation tools through explicit broadcast intents. Launcher shortcuts open Export, Schedule, and History.

### Export Destinations

Android file exports use the Storage Access Framework, so users can choose local folders or provider-backed folders exposed by Google Drive, OneDrive, Syncthing, Obsidian Sync, or another document provider.

Compatibility API export sends one `healthmd.api_export` JSON envelope to a user-configured HTTPS endpoint. It supports optional encrypted Bearer/Basic authorization and validated request headers, standard HTTPS redirects, manual uploads, scheduled WorkManager uploads, partial-date diagnostics, and target-aware retries.

Raw API Snapshot delivery uses a separate streaming contract. It requires HTTPS, rejects redirects, includes schema/export/checksum headers, and deletes the temporary private artifact after the upload attempt. Unsafe framing and proxy header overrides remain blocked for both products.

## Pricing

Health.md includes **3 free manual export actions** so you can verify permissions, folder access, formats, and your Obsidian workflow.

Unlimited exports and scheduled automation are unlocked with a **one-time lifetime purchase** through Google Play Billing. No subscription. No recurring charge. The live price is shown by Google Play inside the app.

The free counter tracks export actions, not files: exporting Markdown + JSON + CSV for a date range still counts as one export action.

## Build Targets

| Gradle target | Application ID / namespace | Platform |
|---------------|----------------------------|----------|
| `:app:assembleDebug` | `com.healthmd.android` / `com.healthmd` | Android debug APK |
| `:app:bundleRelease` | `com.healthmd.android` / `com.healthmd` | Google Play AAB |
| `:app:testDebugUnitTest` | `com.healthmd` | JVM unit and contract tests |
| `:app:connectedDebugAndroidTest` | `com.healthmd.android` | Instrumented Android tests |

## Setup

1. Install Android Studio with JDK 17 and the Android SDK.
2. Open this repository in Android Studio and let Gradle sync.
3. Use a Health Connect-capable device or emulator.
4. Run the debug app and grant Health Connect permissions.
5. Choose an export folder through Android's folder picker.
6. Optional: choose an Obsidian vault or synced provider folder if your document provider exposes write access through the Storage Access Framework.

### Build from CLI

```bash
# Debug build
./gradlew :app:assembleDebug

# Install debug build on the connected device
./gradlew :app:installDebug

# Release app bundle for Google Play
./gradlew :app:bundleRelease
```

Release signing is loaded from `local.properties` and must never be committed:

```properties
RELEASE_STORE_FILE=health-md-release.jks
RELEASE_STORE_PASSWORD=...
RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS=...
RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD=...
```

First-party campaign attribution is disabled for central reporting unless the deployed Cloudflare ingestion base URL is supplied. The production token is abuse throttling, not a true secret:

```bash
./gradlew :app:assembleDebug \
  -PCAMPAIGN_ATTRIBUTION_ENDPOINT_URL=https://healthmd.app \
  -PCAMPAIGN_ATTRIBUTION_INGEST_TOKEN=replace-with-throttling-token
```

The same names may be supplied as environment variables. Release builds require HTTPS; debug builds allow HTTP only on localhost. See [First-party campaign attribution](docs/campaign-attribution.md).

### Google Play Publisher

Gradle Play Publisher and Fastlane are both configured for Play Console uploads. Keep the service-account JSON outside the repo and pass its path through an environment variable or Gradle property:

```bash
PLAY_CONSOLE_KEY_PATH="$HOME/.config/play-console/health-md-android.json" ./gradlew :app:publishBundle
```

See `GRADLE_PLAY_PUBLISHER_SETUP.md`, `PLAY_STORE_SETUP.md`, and `GOOGLE_PLAY_BILLING_SETUP.md` for release setup notes.

## Testing

Run the unit and export-contract suite:

```bash
./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest
```

Focused commands:

```bash
./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest --tests com.healthmd.export.PluginCompatibilityValidationTest
./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest --tests com.healthmd.exportcontract.ReleaseReadinessTest
./gradlew :app:lintDebug
./gradlew :app:connectedDebugAndroidTest
```

The export-contract tests verify Android compatibility output against the iOS Health.md schema and obsidian-health-md plugin, plus raw snapshot/record/change schemas, field ledgers, deterministic checksums, pagination, privacy boundaries, and crash-safe incremental state transitions.

## Permissions & Entitlements

Health.md requests permissions only when a feature needs them:

- **Health Connect read access** — required to export selected health categories
- **Health Connect historical access** — used for large manual exports beyond the normal read window
- **Health Connect background access** — used only when scheduled exports are enabled
- **Notifications** — optional status notifications for completed or failed scheduled exports
- **Boot completed** — reschedules exports after device restart
- **User-selected files** — writes to folders chosen through Android's Storage Access Framework
- **Explicit automation receiver** — allows Tasker/adb integrations without implicit broadcast triggers

## Privacy

Health data stays local-first:

- Health Connect records are read on Android and written directly to folders you choose.
- Exports can target local/provider-backed folders or an HTTPS API endpoint explicitly configured by the user; Health.md does not run a health-data cloud.
- Optional direct cloud-provider imports use provider OAuth tokens stored on-device; enabling those providers sends requests directly to that provider's API.
- Scheduled exports run locally through WorkManager and use Health Connect background access only when you enable scheduling.
- Export history and settings are stored locally with Room and DataStore.
- Billing is handled by Google Play; health samples and exported files are not sent to a Health.md server. API Endpoint records travel directly to the user-configured service.
- Health.md uses no third-party analytics or attribution SDK. Its first-party redirect service records campaign-link clicks; on Android, Google Play Install Referrer can associate a resulting install with a validated campaign.
- Campaign attribution sends only random app-install/event UUIDs, app version/build, optional Play timestamps, and sanitized campaign token/source/medium/content metadata to a configured first-party Cloudflare endpoint. It never sends the raw referrer, Advertising ID, Android ID, hardware identifiers, health data, exports, account data, or file/folder information.
- If the campaign endpoint is unconfigured or offline, the sanitized event remains pending locally and never blocks startup. The deployed companion Worker stores allowlisted events in D1, deduplicates by event/install UUID, and joins aggregate installs to redirect clicks by campaign token.
- Feedback, GitHub issues, Discord links, and review prompts are user-initiated.

If you want the strictest local setup, use manual Device Folder exports, choose a local-device folder, leave API Endpoint unconfigured, and disable Scheduled Exports.
